            <title><![CDATA[Immersive Toolkits and Social Toolkits]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Immersive Toolkits and Social Toolkits</h1><p>All space has a behaviour prescribed to it (whether or not that prescription has a lasting effect or not is a discussion for another day). Libraries evoke a sense of focus and reflection; urban parks, when designed successfully, promote a sense of calmness and are inclusive of all; corporate headquarters are often inside of structures that speak to the might of man, something that is especially true for complexes of matching buildings such as the TD complex designed by Mies van der Rohe. What behaviours are prescribed to a bar during its inception and operation? Generally, a bar is a social space; a place to engage with a personal social toolkit. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a31866582b1420849aa5c965766d7987a43df3bc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Space, and How to Avoid Novelty]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Space, and How to Avoid Novelty</h1><p>Goran Peuc recently penned an article for Smashing Magazine titled "Nobody Wants to Use Your Product", which correctly asserts that users of a product are interested in the end result, and not the process that they have to go through to get there. Although the article is referring to products, websites, and applications, many of the ideas can be applied to space. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/eaac24a9406566c7009a35e4208f1e3fe90d34f8.jpg"></article>]]></description>
