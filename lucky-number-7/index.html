<p><i></i></p><p><i>On Laziness</i></p><p><i>Post #7</i></p><p>Close to home, you could say. </p><p>To my lab partners, I'm probably that guy. The one who pays for school and doesn't attend, the dude relying on you to catch him up with what he's missed. The kind of person you don't want on your team.</p><p>I recently read Yuki Noguchi's piece "<i>Before you Judge Lazy Workers, Consider They Might Serve a Purpose</i>", and found the idea of a backup labor force, or demand for a certain laziness to exist as a means of long term support intriguing.  Her article highlights the research done by Eisuke Hasegawa, a professor of agriculture at Hokkaido University, which found that half of the ants in a colony are not actually doing anything. The reserve ants would respond to a stimulus to work, and then sit still during periods of no work. </p><p>Now, this seems to imply that I'll respond to a stimulus for work, which is probably incorrect. I just don't have the heart to work on things that I don't personally believe in. TL;DR, I've got a thick skull. </p><p>The article goes on to mention the value of speed over efficiency, in that operating on a faster level then your teammates might not actually help anyone. This is what I have found to be the most interesting, in all the work I have done on my personal pursuits, educational pursuits, and specifically creative pursuits. </p><p>Truth be told, the concepts and strategies that I think on the longest are the ones that leave a lasting effect. If the investment is watching the sun rise and the sun set, the idea, even if its a terrible one, has a presence that is otherwise lacking when urgency is simulated. I understand that school operates on a strict timeline, and that real world collaborative and personal design efforts are usually based on some kind of commission, and thus also have a deadline. But in 2016 everything is immediate, and urgency is a common thread holding systems together. Communication is second nature; we can talk to anyone, anywhere, anytime, all the time. With this in mind, work and play has blended together. But is the immediacy diluting our awareness of time? </p><p>I'm pretty sure it is. </p><p>Rather than considering relevant implications of briefs, we worry about the immediate reaction to these briefs. Instead of researching, or at least simulating real research principals, we push on ahead and run into fundamental crisis during development. Perhaps these crisis happen post development as well. These are things that happen in all levels of design, tangible or not, personal or public, small or large. Again, to say double the timespan of all projects would be silly, and detrimental to the development of anything. But time has to be appreciated. If not for the health of those putting work into something, then for the people who will be using that something. Cheap and stale will often break and become passe. </p><p>Does this imply that I've been spending each night researching what it takes to blend interaction design and a bar? No, although I have been thinking a great deal on the future of usable tech and food service. There are a number of institutions in our culture that have existed for centuries. Comfort with these institutions does not mean that they are without several levels of complication and abstraction. What I do still firmly believe is that more time and encouragement to research and question these levels would lead to more permanent fixes to those that are problems, and a better understanding and appreciation for those levels that add to the character of a space. </p><p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it. </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="35"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="37"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="38"><span data-reactid="39"><!-- react-empty: 40 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="41"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="42">Lucky Number 7</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="43"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="44"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="45"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
