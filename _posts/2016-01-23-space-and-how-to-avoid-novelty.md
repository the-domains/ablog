This past Thursday the post grad students of George Brown's Interactive Media Management program presented ["Hi-Jack"][0], a vision for an interactive bar. While still being early in development, the presentation focused on embedding new technology in older, analogue systems. It was under this guise that the students believed they were adding layers of interactivity to an otherwise static institution. Unfortunately, the concept had one significant flaw (thankfully addressed by some of the admins). Rather than attempt to streamline the process of embedding technology into a system that doesn't need it, we must focus on the question of "Why?"; why are we attempting to disrupt a system that has existed for centuries? The correct way to go about reinventing this system is to first ask why patrons are in a bar. Common sense points us to think that most bar-goers are seeking a direct social interaction with another person / people (unless of course, they are seeking no social interaction by rather a nulling of an inner social conversation. People drink when they're blue!). But this too can be held in question as novelty bars continue to appear and offer new interactive experiences\*. 

Goran Peuc recently penned an article for _Smashing Magazi__ne _titled "Nobody Wants to Use Your Product", which correctly asserts that users of a product are interested in the end result, and not the process that they have to go through to get there. Although the article is referring to products, websites, and applications, many of the ideas can be applied to space. 

He suggests several tools to use during product iteration, such as:

- Intelligently employ a no-interface design. 

- Design systems, not pieces.

- Work backwards to develop results, rather than use. 

From this, I suggest that we focus on developing a space that is non obtrusive, and maintain the common principals of a bar setting. We also must focus on the interaction between patrons and the space, and how it can be reflected to encourage patrons to engage with each-other. To do this, we as a research group must consider the **layers of complexity **that a bar contains. This means examining the obstacles that a patron faces from the moment they walk through the door to the exact moment they achieve the end result they are seeking. 

Primary research should start with a consensus on what patrons seek when they go to a bar, followed by narrowing it down to a general end result that our primary demographic would be seeking. Moving backwards from this, we can determine what each layer of complexity is, and which ones need to be addressed. We must also consider that a layer of complexity may be intentionally employed to encourage / promote a certain emotional response.

Technology might have a place in the service industry, but I think the interactive bar is more than screens in the walls and wireless chargers in tables.

\*Snakes and Lagers is an example of a successful interactive bar.
