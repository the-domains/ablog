_Space, and How to Avoid Novelty_

Thursday's presentation of "High Jack" had a significant flaw, which was thankfully addressed (and then unfortunately corrected by poor examples of novelty service establishments). This flaw is the question of "why?", mainly regarding the emphasis on embedding technology into a system that already works quite well. The correct way to reinvent a bar space is to first ask what patrons want when they go to a bar. I think common sense points us to think that most bar-goers are seeking a direct social interaction with another person (unless of course, they are seeking no social interaction but rather a nulling of an inner social conversation. People drink when they're blue!). But this too can be held in question as novelty bars continue to appear in an effort to build new interactive experiences.

Goran Peuc recently penned an article for _Smashing Magazine _title "Nobody Wants to Use Your Product", which correctly asserts that users are interested in the end result, and not the process that they go through to achieve it. Although the paper is focusing on user interaction with a specific device, website, or application, many of the principals can be expanded to reflect a user interaction with _space._

He argues several key points, the most relevant ones I will list here:

* Intelligently employ a no-interface design. Our space should be as non-obtrusive as any other analogue bar, and maintain the common principal of a bar setting.
* Design systems, not pieces. Focus should be on the interaction with space, not with the technology embedded into furniture.
* And finally, that we should be working backwards to develop _results, not use._

We need to consider the **layers of complexity **that a bar contains. What this means is calculating how many obstacles there are between a patron entering and engaging in what they are seeking.

For primary research, we must reach a consensus on what a patron is seeking when they go to a bar. Moving backwards from these results, we can determine those layers of complexity and offer ideas on how to address each one (It is also possible that these layers of complexity are employed intentionally by a space in order to promote certain emotions).
