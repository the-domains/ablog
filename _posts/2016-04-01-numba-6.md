There has been a cluster of activity regarding Canada's mention of a universal basic income, or UBI. Finland and Switzerland have also made moves to implement a UBI in an effort to free people from "the bullshit". It also would theoretically reduce strain on education and healthcare, and equalize the lower and middle class.   

With regards to this program and collaborative design efforts, would a UBI encourage the use of **_charrettes_** to solve urban, political, and perhaps domestically relevant problems? Traditionally, collaborative design is the ultimate in design strategy as it speaks to the widest array of people (and is designed across multiple disciplines and made from a number of different views). But these processes are normally slow, expensive, and at the mercy of sometimes un-sympathetic investors. 

To be honest, I saw a lot of problems with our collaborative output in the first several weeks of development. There was little cohesion, and there was some subtle infighting and a general displeasure with accepting that an idea _may have actually been ill conceived. _But it happens. 

However, collaboration between multiple levels of government has often times shown promise, and hiring consultants across disciplines has been known to yield more respectful results in the redevelopment of systems and neighborhoods. But what if solitary investment from a coroporation was not the primary source for a development? If people were "freed from bullshit" and had a stable, ongoing income, would they be encouraged to finance their own personal pursuits? If those personal pursuits were found to match anothers, would they work together? Would interpersonal pursuits become the norm as classes merged and the lines between you and your neighbor began to blur? 

Who the fuck knows, but I'm going to be cautiously optimistic and say that the future of society relies more on collaborative input from everyone on a micro-level, then from investors on a major level.
