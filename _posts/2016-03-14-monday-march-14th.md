_I was going to talk about consensus in the context of collaborative design, but I didn't feel like writing a fiction. The wounds are fresh, forgive me. _

**This weeks curiosities are:**

- How can Toronto partake in numerous public projects at once? 

- What are the implications of zoning delineation? Can we operate in a city with zoning principals rather than restrictions? \*Mention the school trying to build student residences in an employment zone. (Thanks for the tip Mom)

- Should transit hubs be restricted to mixed housing?
