****Recursive Prototyping****

Can a cycle of rapid prototyping solve the problem of cities? Perhaps. This theory stems form the slowing of ideation and creation that is often a product of searching for issues to perfect a product, or from the  lack of consensus within a design group. But how can rapidly prototyping fixes to solve issues such as available housing, bloated essentials like the police, inaccessible and overcrowded transit, and middle ground systems like the cab industry and telecommunications? Especially when they are up against decades of impenetrable english in legislation at varying levels of government? 

I think it comes down to strategically disabling bylaws and guidelines, to encourage the controlled ideation of a more efficient and effective future. Honestly, much of the impenetrable english was written to _prevent _change from the onset. Can affordable housing be offered while providing enough incentive to engage private developers? Can middle ground industries like cabs and internet be advanced and available while helping the corporate bodies that currently control them? Unfortunately, without an understanding of the various systems in place that currently manage these systems, much of this is purely theoretical. But consider implementing small, localized changes overnight. We can call this the "wet paint tactic".

_- _**The Esplanade |**_Massive development on the Esplanade in Toronto. The mix of rent controlled, market rate, and city owned housing creates a densely pipulated and diverse neighborhood in a once forgotten part of downtown Toronto. It was the relaxed zoning restrictions that enabled this self-resetting development. _

_An example:_

Engage a neighborhood by turning its narrow streets into contraflow bike streets, like the ones on Shaw and Simcoe. Many small neighborhoods would benefit from slower moving traffic, and increased flow of cyclists. Or perhaps forget the contra flow bike lanes and shift the narrow downtown residential streets into interlocking one way avenues. It is thought that converting lower Dovercourt into a one way southbound street will actually raise property values. ![Contra Flow lanes on Shaw](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0666967e856fd8e53972cc533b854a6ee5aa9ded.jpg)

The data that real world initiatives yield is infinitely more valuable than that of models and analysis of past data. This is because humans are reactionary. If services are provided, people will use them. While they are absent, city goers will look for the next available system. 

What happens then when the paint washes away? The system can start again, with ideation that branches from the valuable data collected in previous tests. The most important step is creation. Ideation can last forever, models can be built and rebuilt, and policy can be argued. But real world application is essential to keep up with the the decaying sets of data, the increasing (and increasingly diverse) population, and the ever evolving ways that we use cities and their services. 

And so, the recursive prototyping continues.
