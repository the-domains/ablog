![A still from Vincent Mah√©'s "Neighbours"](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c2b2de4ff9306a37dc28ffedbf0de4d4c10108a9.jpg)

All space has a behaviour prescribed to it (whether or not that prescription has a lasting effect or not is a discussion for another day). Libraries evoke a sense of focus and reflection; urban parks, when designed successfully, promote a sense of calmness and are inclusive of all; corporate headquarters are often inside of structures that speak to the might of man, something that is especially true for complexes of matching buildings such as the TD complex designed by Mies van der Rohe. _What behaviours are prescribed to a bar during its inception and operation? _Generally, a bar is a social space; a place to engage with a personal social toolkit. 

In looking at "Hi-Jack", we should make sure that our _immersive toolkit _is compatible with the prescribed_social toolkit, _in that it does not conflict with the social behaviours of our patrons. I suggest looking at installations like the "Marseille Vieux Port" installation by Foster + Partners, or the "Cloud Gate" by Anish Kapoor. Both of these installations provide a passive and participatory experience to passers by (as they "happen" even without direct input from someone, and they can both be experienced by numerous people at the same time).
